## For RBAC support:
rbac:
  create: true

  ## Define specific rbac permissions.
  ## DEPRECATED: see .Values.rbac.rules
  # resources: ["pods", "pods/exec", "secrets"]
  # verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "patch", "delete"]

  ## Define list of rules to be added to the rbac role permissions.
  ## Each rule supports the keys:
  ## - apiGroups: default "" (indicates the core API group) if missing or empty.
  ## - resources: default "*" if missing or empty.
  ## - verbs: default "*" if missing or empty.
